## How to install Reactive Extensions for .NET 4.0 Beta 2 on VS2010 RC 

  1. Get the [.NET 4.0 Beta 2 download](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/ee794896.aspx) from MSDN. 
  2. Open the downloaded .exe with [7zip](www.7-zip.org/) (i.e. right-click on file, select 7-Zip > Open Archive)

Enjoy!
