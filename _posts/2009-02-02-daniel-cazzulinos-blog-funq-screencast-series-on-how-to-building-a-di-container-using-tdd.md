## Funq: screencast series on how to building a DI container using TDD 

Over the past few days, I spent some time recording the experience of building a dependency injection container using test driven development. It was a cool experience for me, and I hope you find the screencasts useful.

Here are all the episode links:

  1. Part I: selecting a high performance approach and building the basics with few lines of code. [View](http://www.viddler.com/explore/dcazzulino/videos/1/)   5. Part V: adding support for container hierarchies. [View](http://www.viddler.com/explore/dcazzulino/videos/6/)   9. Part IX: how well does it perform really? [View](http://www.viddler.com/explore/dcazzulino/videos/10/) | [Download](http://cloud.funq.me/part9.mp4)

Funq is by no means a revolutionary concept to DI, I'm well aware of that. But it's one that takes a minimalistic approach to keep the performance impact of DI to a bare minimum. One of the project core requirements was to perform very well on the Compact Framework, as part of its inclusion in the upcoming [Mobile Client Software Factory v2](http://www.codeplex.com/mobile) from [patterns & practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices).

I hope this series serves to understand the inner workings of this fully functional yet extremely simple DI container.
