## CAB (Composite UI Application Block) hands on labs @ Redmond: fully packed and fun! 

We're having our first lab on [CAB](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/projects/cab), with people from all over the country (US). It went incredible well. People seem to find CAB very useful and intuitive so far, and they certainly think we're solving a lot of the recurring problems they find when building rich smart client applications. We got lots of good feedback. Very engaging overall.   
We got a very cool lab room at [building 20](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3700+156th+NE,+Redmond,+WA&hl=en) that contained a huge proyector screen and 93 seats with fancy LCDs with movable arms. Impressive.   
  
There was also an entire fridge full of [Haagen-Dazs ice cream](http://www.haagen-dazs.com/home.do), which is always a plus ;)
