I hate to do this again. For most well-developed, web-friendly sites (yeah, there are sites that are not friendly at all with the [web architecture](http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/)), search engines will be a great aid in spreading the word. For example, if you [search Google for "TechEd GAT Hands On Lab"](http://www.google.com/search?q=teched+gat+hands+on+lab), right on the first result page you will get what you look for, even if the website was launched just a ***week*** ago. Now, [do the same for SgmlReader](http://www.google.com/search?q=SgmlReader), a user sample in [GotDotNet](http://gotdotnet.com/) which tons of weblogs and articles link to, and the only one with such a name: you will get it in the ****seventh**** page, even if it has been around for years. Enough said...
