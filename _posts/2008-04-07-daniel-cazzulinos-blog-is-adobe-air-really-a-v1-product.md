## Is Adobe AIR really a v1 product? 

![snitter AIR app taking 115mb of memory](https://web.archive.org/web/20080503171841im_/http://www.clariusconsulting.net/images/blogs/kzu/IsAdobeAIRreallyav1product_1098D/image.png)

That's a [TINY app](http://snook.ca/snitter/) built with [Adobe AIR](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) taking roughly 112Mb of memory?!

If only MS made [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) available for standalone apps too... I'm willing to bet they'll do much better than this even for their initial release with .NET built-in (Silverlight 2.0).
