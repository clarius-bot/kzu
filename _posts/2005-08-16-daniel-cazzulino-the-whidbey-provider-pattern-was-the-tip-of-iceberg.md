## The Whidbey provider pattern was the tip of iceberg 

I have [complained in the past](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/03/22/93838.aspx) about the shortcomings of the [Whidbey provider pattern](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaspnet/html/asp02182004.asp?frame=true&hidetoc=true) (ASP.NET should I say?), which I always regarded as woefully inadecuate as a general purpose pattern for complex blocks and pluggable providers. At [ClariuS](http://clariusconsulting.net/) it's not our style to just complain, so we got [one of our brightest brains](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/fds/) to work on [Enterprise Library](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/projects/entlib) and do something about it. [The result is amazing](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/fds/archive/2005/08/16/38.aspx): both simple yet incredible powerful and flexible. I would bet you will see his code in VS Orcas! Don't miss his first [post explaining what it's all about](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/fds/archive/2005/08/16/38.aspx).
