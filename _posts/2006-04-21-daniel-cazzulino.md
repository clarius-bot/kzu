## MSDN Architecture Webcast: Extending Microsoft patterns & practices ObjectBuilder 

Today I presented a [webcast on p&p ObjectBuilder](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-us&EventID=1032293738&CountryCode=us "MSDN Architecture Webcast: Extending Microsoft patterns & practices ObjectBuilder \(Level 200\)") (OB), the underpinning framework powering [CAB](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/apptype/smartclient/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/cab.asp "Smart Client - Composite UI Application Block at MSDN") and [EntLib v2.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/EntLib2.asp "Enterprise Library for .NET Framework 2.0").

I'm afraid I tried to cover too much ground and the result was a pretty fast and maybe hard to follow session. I think it would have been much better to do an OB introduction webcast alone, and then another one on how to extend it. My apologies for that. I'll appreciate your feedback. 

I showed some examples of how to use OB programmatically, as well as how to extend it. You can [download the source](http://clariusconsulting.net/downloads/farcaster.zip "Sample code showcasing OB, Spring and Pico together"), which is fairly big as it contains [Pico.NET](http://www.picocontainer.org/ "PicoContainer site") and [Spring.NET](http://www.springframework.org/ "SpringFramework homepage") in addition to OB itself. Also, you will see a side-by-side example of [Fowler's MovieFinder example](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html "Martin Fowler on Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern") running in all three frameworks, so you can appreciate the differences.

Hi Daniel,   
  
I really liked the web cast on Object Builder. While it was nice to see a practical example of its use in CAB, it would help me more if you focused on an example like your BuilderContainer. It's there that I feel like you could show us more on how to use object builder in our own applications. Also like to see an example of how to use the locator and lifetime container, and how they relate. Also like to see an example of how to insert / find things in the locator/container. One of the things we'd like to do is use an object context for our business objects, and be able to find them (by custom key) if they are already loaded etc.   
  
Great job overall. Thanks so much for this and I really look forward to more web casts from you - I find it very helpful.

Hi Daniel,   
  
I was only able to partially follow your webcast because I had some sound problems with Media Player. After debugging the damn thing I did find the plugin which caused me the trouble. Could you post when/if avaliable a link where the recorded session can be viewed again?   
  
Yours,

Great feedback Steve. I'll try to arrange another webcast with a stronger focus on using OB standalone. [](javascript:__doPostBack\('_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$Comments$_ctl0$Comments$_ctl2$EditLink',''\))

Hi Daniel   
  
Good job in doing an overall presentation of ObjectBuilder. Actually one of the first I have seen. Thanks for that.   
  
However as you noticed yourself it would be great if this cast is going to be in two session. One introduction where ObjectBuilder (DI concept) is explained and how it is used in different projects (CAB, EL 2.0).   
Next session on extensibility of ObjectBuilder, maybe starting out with CAB and EL 2.0, since HOW they use the ObjectBuilder is actually quite different in my opinion. Finishing session two of with "How to create and integrate your own builder" topics.   
  
As user (still on rookie level) of ObjectBuilder in my own application (WCF Services), I would have enjoyed to see more scenarios in which the ObjectBuilder could be utilized.   
Basically I need to answer my "inner voice" question:   
I have implemented my own builder. The work it performs does the right stuff, but did I implement it correctly?   
  
Anyway. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and keep up the good work. Hope you can use the feedback I gave you.   
  
Regards

My team like Steve is interested in using ObjectBuilder for building business objects. We are thinking of having a custom implementation through which we can do data mapping, caching, and lazy loading of data from the database. In your opinion which implementation (CAB, EntLib, Farcaster) is the best starting point for guidance on using ObjectBuilder in this fashion?
