I would like to thank ( //the-ones-that-nominated-me[@MS or @otherwise] ) for the MVP award MS gave me on the XML area. It's certainly heartwarming to see one's efforts recognized. I've just read [DonXML](http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2004/01/20/332.aspx) is onboard too. That's great.  
I will do my best to keep up with my community contributions during this year. Lots of projects are shaping, both in my mind and through my hands ;).   
_Updated_ : [Oleg](http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/archives/000145.html) has been awarded too. Cool!
