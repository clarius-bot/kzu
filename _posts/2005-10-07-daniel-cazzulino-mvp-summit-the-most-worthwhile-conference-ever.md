## MVP Summit: the most worthwhile conference ever 

This week I came back from the [MVP 2005](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/sep05/09-29MVPSummit05PR.mspx) [Global Summit](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/sep05/09-29MVPSummit.mspx). This conference is IMO the most unique and valuable conference Microsoft organizes. Surely, you need to be an MVP to attend ;).  
  
Most notable, however, is our product team. The [XML team](http://blogs.msdn.com/xmlteam/) organized two days of amazing sessions that were as much a two-way dialog as you can imagine. We discussed all kinds of things, from current (Whidbey, that is) technology to what's coming in the future. It was awesome to feel that they really wanted to know what we wanted for the future, as well as the honest interest they had in our thoughts. We even got to share a couple hours with [Anders Heljsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg) talking and discussing [Linq, XLinq and the future of C# and XML](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/). Simply priceless.  
  
This year was the biggest MVP Summit ever, with more than 1500 people from more than 70 countries. An incredible success for a program that is becoming more and more important as a way for Microsoft to interact with the community of people passionate about MS technology like myself. I feel very proud of belonging to this select group of people.
