#####  [The best browser ever!](http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2004/06/25/255.aspx)

I've been using [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) for a while now. It used to be FireBird when I started, and it's been my default browser ever since. But every new version surprises me, as well the constant availability and improvement of all sorts of [ extensions](http://update.mozilla.org/?application=firefox) to it, as well as a growing number of [ themes](http://update.mozilla.org/themes/?application=firefox) to make it look even better. 

For example, I stumbled across the [ Google Toolbar](http://googlebar.mozdev.org/screenshots.html). It even supports features not available in the [ Google-provided IE toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/)! Amazing. And I can't live anymore without the extensible search functionality:

![FireFox search box, showing alternative search engines](https://web.archive.org/web/20060519104241im_/http://aspnet2.com/kzu/weblog/firefoxsearch.png)

It has a sleek design, way better than aged IE one: 

![FireFox options dialog, way better than IE](https://web.archive.org/web/20060519104241im_/http://aspnet2.com/kzu/weblog/firefoxoptions.png)

And there's an absolutely must-have extension that allows me to open those everytime-less-often pages that can only be browsed with IE: 

![FireFox extension that allows you to view a page in IE](https://web.archive.org/web/20060519104241im_/http://aspnet2.com/kzu/weblog/firefoxviewinie.png)

And there's even an [ActiveX wrapper](http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/control.htm) that hosts the Gecko rendering engine (the one behind FireFox, Mozilla and Netscape) and that implements all the interfaces of the IE WebBrowser control. This means you can get rid of the buggy-non-standard-old jscript-aged IE browser for your embedded browser needs!

As if it wasn't enough, [Mono](http://go-mono.org/) has a [ Gecko#](http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Jun-14.html) project in the works! IE is dead. Way [ toooo late](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2366#2366) to make anything useful to it to catch up with the new wave of internet browsers. I sincerely hope all developers start using FireFox, deploying it, and making web apps that leverage the power of the latest W3C standards. For most extranet/intranet applications, you can control the browser. Go fight for any Gecko-based browser. You'll make yourself a big favor by avoiding IE quicks. You'll also contribute in forcing Microsoft to stop toying with the idea that they can control the internet, its content, and the platform through XAML, Avalon and whatever they invent for that purpose. Dynamic and useful websites were largely possible thanks to MS innovation back in the browser wars days. Don't let them abandon that path. It's the one that benefits us all, just as it did by freeing us from the even-more-buggy Netscape Navigator 4. 

**Update:** I forgot to mention the most important thing for newcomers: FireFox setup for Windows is only **4.7 MB**!!! That's even less the size that Netscape Navigator 3.04 had (5.53 MB)!!! Compare that with the incredibly huge **77.51 MB** of IE6+SP1...

There's an interesting [article on the revival of the browsers war on XML.com](http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2004/06/16/deviant.html).

#####  [High-performance XML (V): in-memory XML Schema validation without re-parsing](http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2004/06/25/253.aspx)

I may have not stressed enough one of the most important features enabled by the [XPathNavigatorReader](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/04/19/115966.aspx): **in-memory (without reparsing) XML Schema validation of arbitrary sources exposed as`XPathNavigator`.**

When XML editing is required, developers typically resort to OuterXml->new XmlTextReader->new XmlValidatingReader->Validate (and re-parse!):

XmlDocument doc = GetModifiedDocument(); // Get the modified doc somehow. // Create the reader from the XML string taken through OuterXml. XmlValidatingReader vr = new XmlValidatingReader( new XmlTextReader(new StringReader(node.OuterXml)));

There is an absolutely unnecessary re-parsing step that degrades performance. The same scenario can be solved trivially with the [ XPathNavigatorReader](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/04/19/115966.aspx):

XmlDocument doc = GetModifiedDocument(); // Get the modified doc somehow. // Create the validating reader with the new reader over the root document navigator XmlValidatingReader vr = new XmlValidatingReader( new XPathNavigatorReader(doc.CreateNavigator()));

That "simple" change completely bypases the need to re-parse the document. Needless to say, the bigger the document, the higher the cost. In my tests with a fairly small document (~50kb) I could save about **30-40% processing time**. And if you use an `XPathDocument` instead, the processing **saving skyrockets to more than 60%**! As usual, this shows the superiority of the `XPathDocument` as a generic XML in-memory store. I can't wait for Whidbey release, when it will offer all of XmlDocument features and more.

As I explained [in my previous post](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/04/19/115966.aspx), there's another interesting story for the `XPathNavigatorReader`, and that's about document fragment validation. As the reader considers the navigator's current position as the root node, you can validate a subset against a refined schema. Specially with complex documents and schemas, this can significantly improve performance too.

The full project source code can be downloaded from [ SourceForge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mvp-xml/Mvp.Xml.zip?download) . 

Enjoy and please give us feedback on the project!
