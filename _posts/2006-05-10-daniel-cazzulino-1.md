#####  [XML DevCon](http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2004/10/21/XmlDevCon2004.aspx)

[The conference](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/conference) has been great. We're approaching the end, and I have to say I'm very satisfied. Even if I was one of the speakers, preaching the benefits of [Schematron](http://xml.ascc.net/resource/schematron/schematron.html) (which went pretty well I think), and therefore didn't have to pay to be here, I'd have gladly done so. The level of talks is high and you get to meet a lot of cool guys from the entire XML space (definitely not only MS guys). No marketing, no beginner's topics, just XML and fun.   
  
If I don't have some really exciting topic to talk about next year that Chris is willing to have on the conference, I honestly expect to be able to come back as an attendant. It's really that good.  
  
Well done Chris!

#####  [XML Litmus test reloaded](http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2004/10/21/298.aspx)

If you get [this face](http://www.douglasp.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=5e8aa9f7-a727-4167-8697-f191d3f4b300) when you explain what you're using XML for, you will know you've not passed the test....

#####  [When a bug that became a really useful feature is fixed: !@#$!@$%@#^%#$%](http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2004/10/21/BugTureFixed.aspx)

The [one bug](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/09/24/BugTure.aspx) I wished was never fixed in VPC has been fixed in SP1. And you need SP1 in order for VPC to run fast in WinXP SP2. Damn!!!!  
  
I'll investigate working with VPC without SP1, and using the addons from Virtual Server 2005, which used to work before....

#####  [Boost XmlSerializer usability and performance by using strongly-typed serializers](http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2004/10/21/XGenToolRelease.aspx)

The XmlSerializer has a farily well-known problem: the first time you use it, it will generate a class to read instances of the received type, compile it, and then load it. Of course, this can take considerable time, directly related to the complexity of the type and all its members and member types.  
  
Unlike common wisdom, this is something that can be avoided and I have explained (albeit rather confusingly) in a [previous post](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/SGen.aspx). The usage was not great, though, as it was a command-line tool: ouch!  
  
So, the [Mvp.Xml](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvp-xml) project debuts with a new package: [Mvp.Xml.Design](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=102352&package_id=133415). Now, in order to get a design-time version of a custom XmlSerializer for a type, you just assign the Mvp.Xml.XGen (renamed from the old SGen name that could be confused with a Whidbey tool of the same name), and you'll get a class to perform serialization of the type. The custom tool will take the first type in the file if multiple classes exist in it. Here's how it will look like:  
  
![A screenshot from VS using the tool](https://web.archive.org/web/20060510152542im_/http://aspnet2.com/kzu/weblog/Mvp.Xml.XGen.png)  
  
The package comes in two flavors: an MSI installer or the raw source. The former also installs the sources besides the custom tool.  
  
[Go download it!](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=102352&package_id=133415)
