## CommentAPI no longer working on .Text 

Adding a feature (namely, the new Url rewriting happening in weblogs.asp.net) and breaking another (much more important) is certainly not good for us. I can no longer post comments from RssBandit. I am frustrated.  
If I had the source code for the current version (that is, if ScottW was so kind as to keep a CVS/GDN updated version I can hack into), I could at least tell what is broken and maybe find a workaround.   
No luck, I guess...
