## Where did MS+IBM joint effort go?!?!?! 

I noticed (like many others) that IBM was missing from [WS-Eventing](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-eventing.asp). If the [reasons initially given](http://www.cbronline.com/latestnews/78de31cdacd1f4be80256e15003b1e8e) by IBM were right, I could be disapointed, but I could understand that they want to sell MQ Series instead of WS-Eventing. However, it appears that they have come up with a competing specification that aims at doing mostly the same thing!!! [WS-Notification](http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2004-01-20-a.html) was released almost at the same time!!!  
So what the hell is going on?!?! Can't they just agree on ONE set of WS-* specs? I'm afraid the WS-* specs will become a nightmare to master (not to mention interop). Looks like everyone wants to be THE ONE that writes the specs...
