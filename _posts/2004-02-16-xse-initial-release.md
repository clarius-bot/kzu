After the [introduction](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/XseIntro.aspx), [some use cases](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/XseTransformations.aspx) and [other stuff](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/XPathNonNs.aspx) that can be done with it, I've finally uploaded the NMatrix.Xml project containing XSE (I will unify Schematron here later). You can download it from the [ASPNET2](http://aspnet2.com/) incubator:  
[.NET 1.x version](http://aspnet2.com/incubator/code/NMatrix.Xml-v1.zip)  
[.NET Whidbey version](http://aspnet2.com/incubator/code/NMatrix.Xml-v2.zip)  

**Update: read these follow-up:**

  * [XSE != XPath != SXPath != XPathReader](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/02/16/XseNotXPath.aspx)
