## AJAX may be the biggest waste of time for the Web 

AJAX is OLD. It's been [around for a decade](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=0cca0b0e-4724-404f-bc43-32a66245abef "Guess who created XMLHTTPRequest?"). It's based on the techniques that exist almost since the web exploded: HTML, Javascript. Both have served the Web well. Both are bound to die.

Seriously: do you really want to develop rich apps using loads of javascript, XML and HTML manipulations? Isn't that more or less what you have been doing for the past decade? And a decade in internet time is a LOT of time!

I don't think the future of the web lives in HTML and forms and javascript. The future of the web should be fully inmersive 3D worlds where you can hang around, look at things, interact with other people/buyers, etc. Imagine what Amazon would be with such an approach. Instead of browsing catalogs, walk past some hall and find all products in a shelf. Look up and see the special offers signs. That's the web I want for the future. What is my broadband's use if all I'm gonna get is faster static flat graphics and buttons and text??? 

There is already a web technology that would readily support building next-generation websites: Flash. It's deployed on **[**98%**](http://www.adobe.com/platform/whitepapers/psgroup_flashplatform.pdf "Brochure of the Flash Platform")** of internet-connected PCs. That's WAY more than any single browser, and most probably more than all XMLHTTPRequest/AJAX-capable browsers together!

And Microsoft is down right with their approach to take over the web: XAML, fully powered by vector graphics that will make those 3D worlds possible. But they made what I think was a terrible mistake: rewrite Flash by themselves. You see, when Vista finally hits the streets, Flash will still be the most mature vector-graphics platform out there, with XAML almost certainly full of bugs and missing lots of features (it's going to be a v1 after all), lack of support and adoption for years, etc. Had Microsoft bought Macromedia/Flash, Vista could have been released at least a year ahead of time, its new UI powered by Flash, and seamlessly integrated with the web.

Now, if somebody is going to do anything to fight MS in this new wave, it'd better start by buying Flash (now owned by Adobe). And there's no-one in a better possition to compete than Google. I just hope Google doesn't waste too much time and money in a decadent platform, and realizes soon enough to survive MS' next attack. 

And if I were Microsoft, I'd leave IE as-is, full of bugs, with a leaky script engine, and maybe make scripts slower in future releases. In the end, improving the browser in a world where they would like everyone to switch to XAML will only benefit Google, who seems to base its strategy in AJAX applications.

mmh. This is like saying the Web is dead because it's been around for so long. Or mail, or the Internet.

Macromedia released Flash 1.0 in 1996, which makes Flash pretty long in the tooth, too. It's really the toolkits and higher level of abstractions available that have rejuvenated AJAX - nobody wants to program assembly language for the web. The overreaching points you raise make the argument less persuasive. [](javascript:__doPostBack\('_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$Comments$_ctl0$Comments$_ctl4$EditLink',''\))

Do you really think AJAX raises the abstraction? I doubt it, and it still needs to work at the HTML markup level in order to so something visible.   
  
Productivity is very very low with any kind of javascript stuff you do. We need better tools, granted, but I don't think really rich UIs like the ones you will start seeing with XAML are going to be even remotely possible with AJAX stuff... it's a dead-end.

And btw, everyone seems to be missing the point. It's not about age strictly. I mention it because everyone seems to be amazed at this "new" AJAX thing, when it's nothing new, that's all. But the important thing is the paradigm change. Away from HTML and forms, and into vector graphics and higher productivity.
