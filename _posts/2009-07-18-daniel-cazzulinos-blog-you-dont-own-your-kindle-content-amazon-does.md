## You Don’t Own Your Kindle Content: Amazon Does 

Yes, what [has been](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/18/amazon_removes_1984_from_kindle/)[reported](http://mashable.com/2009/07/17/amazon-kindle-1984/)[already](http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/drm/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218501227) is indeed very true. 

I bought [1984](http://www.amazon.com/Nineteen-Eighty-Four/dp/B002A9JO9W) a while back (from another publisher, though). Hadn’t started it yet, but all of a sudden, it was gone yesterday. Got a refund email from Amazon for it, a refund I never asked (and I never asked to the return the item either).   

Just a couple hours ago, though, I got an explanation from Amazon:

> We have recently refunded your purchase of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) by George Orwell. This book was added to our catalog using our self-service platform by a third-party who did not have the rights to the books. When we were notified of this by the rights holder, we removed the illegal copies from our systems and refunded previous customers. We are working with the authorized rights holder to make this title available in our store very soon. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

Amazon has made a couple not-too-smart choices lately. This one, and [not allowing you to re-download](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200154210&#copy) your purchased DRM-free MP3 music.

I sincerely hope they fix both.
