## Installing Windows Live Writer on Windows 2008 

How long can it take to update a [crappy installer](http://get.live.com/writer/) and remove a hard-coded platform check?? Whatever...

From this [german blog](http://www.live-writer.de/windows-live-writer-download/), get the straight [WLW 2008 MSI](http://www.live-writer.de/wp-content/binary/Installer-Windows-Live-Writer-2008-EN.msi) which works like a charm.
