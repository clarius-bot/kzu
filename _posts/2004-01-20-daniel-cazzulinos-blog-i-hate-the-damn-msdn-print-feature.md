## I hate the damn MSDN print feature 

Every now and then I make the big mistake of clicking that damn Print button at the right on MSDN articles, only to realize that most of the time the text gets cut to the right on the paper. I [have already](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/01/08/48613.aspx) complained about the pain of printing on the web (on badly designed sites, i.e. NOT like [XML.com](http://www.xml.com/) or [CNET](http://www.cnet.com/)).   
Well, IMO, MSDN wins all prizes for bad print-friendliness. Poping-up that f**g window is just SO annoying! And thanks God the site is for DEVELOPERS! (that's the "D" in "MSDN", or is it "Microsoft Droid Network?!?!)   
One more time, Mozilla (Firebird actually) doesn't let me down, and at least MSDN pages aren't so "intelligent" as to ruin my browsing experience, and at least I get a view of what it's f**g trying to print. 

For the curious, I was trying to print [Keith Pijanowski](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwebsrv/html/insidewsdl.asp) article. For the spanish-taking, and who know that the first part of his last name doesn't mean "yuppie", poor guy. Somebody please tell him, as he even shortens his name [KeithPij.org](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwebsrv/html/insidewsdl.asp#insidewsdl_code1), which pronounced fast sounds really bad around here... (Argentina) 

_Updated:_ What's more, if you want to get rid of the floating panel and the bottom voting panel, just [use Firebird EditCSS extension](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/01/08/48613.aspx) as I explained, and just add the following styles to the bottom of it: 

`
    
    
    .MNPPart { display: none; }
    #frmRatings { display: none; }
    #msviFooter { display: none; }

`

Enjoy.
