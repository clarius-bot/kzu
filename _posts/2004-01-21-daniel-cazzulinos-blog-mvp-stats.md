## MVP Stats 

Now that I'm an MVP, I wanted to know how many colleagues I have around the globe, as well as how many XML ones. From the [official MVP list](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;en-us;mvpaward#XML) (does not contain recently announced MVPs), and the [spanish-specifc](http://www.microsoft.com/spanish/msdn/mvpdetalle.asp) list:

MVPs around the worldArgentina MVPs|  _Updated: 17_  
XML MVPs in Latam| none!  
XML MVPs in Argentina| none!  
  
The more amazed I am with the award :o)
