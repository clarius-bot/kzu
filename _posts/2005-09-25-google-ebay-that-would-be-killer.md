  * [eBay bought Skype](http://skype.com/company/news/2005/skype_ebay.html) (GTalk is not even close to Skype feature-wise)   

  * eBay owns PayPal (which is increasingly the internet payment method of choice, IMO)  

  * Froogle is OK, but lucks the market on eBay
  * both have tons of money

  
Looks like the killer recipe for a world-changing (more than they have, already) company if they merge, or am I just dreaming? (not the first one to dream about it, for sure)  
I'm not sure about Amazon... it has competing technologies with both eBay (lots of third-party stores sell through both) and Google (i.e. A9 search engine)... but they could all three join forces, yes... that would be so good but at the same time damn scaring!
