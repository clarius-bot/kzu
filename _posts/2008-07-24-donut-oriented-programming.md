**Donut Oriented Programming** : DOP is a required discipline that you need to adhere to when your app will use VERY slow internet connection, such as in Cambodia and some other developing countries. Every action on the application that requires a roundrip to a server on the internet, should result in a donut being displayed to indicate that something is going on.
