## Portable DVD player vs PlayStation Portable vs PictureFrame w/video 

I want DivX playback. I want a decent screen size. I want easy photo slideshows. I want a single device.

Turns out there's no easy answer for that combination. PSP entered the scene thanks to [Scott](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/squishingtvontoyourpsp.aspx "Scott Hanselman post on getting TV on PSP"), and now the choice is even harder.

On the one hand, traditonal portable DVD players, there’s the excelent [Phillips PET1000](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AM7I30/), which is [DivX certified](http://www.divx.com/products/hw/detail.php?p=119) and has a very cool design and “huge” 10’’ screen. It’s pretty much the only one with DivX playback. But photo slideshow requires you to burn a CD :(. No way to just take the [2GB ultra-fast CompactFlash](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820160033) out of my [Canon Rebel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C8VEK/) and show the family. 

Then comes [PSP](http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx), which is also impressive, is even cooler and also has the games bonus, but it has only a 4.3’’ widescreen display. I could put movies and music in a couple [1GB memorysticks](http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80421), but I have to do a conversion from my CF :(. 

Finally, there’s a [digital frame](http://www.jr.com/JRProductPage.process?Product=4073800) which is basically an LCD with a multi-format card reader that can also display video. Sounds like what I need, but its screen resolution is far from optimal and it’s only 8’’ (although bigger than the PSP for sure).

And it all started with the idea of having a big picture (i.e. the size of the [really cool 24’’ wide Dell monitor](http://www1.ap.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/monitor_2405fpw?c=hk&l=en&s=dhs)) hanging on a wall on our living room, doing a slideshow of pictures coming from a CF or SD or Wi-Fi. Then, not finding a big enough “picture frame” I started dreaming of the single device. 

In the end, I think I’d need to get a big LCD display, an [embedded linux processor](http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4313418436.html), a compact Wi-Fi chip or something like that, a [multi-card reader](http://www.transcendusa.com/products/ModDetail.asp?ModNo=94&LangNo=0) and somehow put it all together and make it look good (or not be visible at all by hiding the duct tape behind the display ;)). I wonder how come nobody came up with such a device yet… (or I missed and I’d certainly like to know about it!!!)

Why not buy a used XBOX classic and install the free XBox Media Center. Then you get a DVD player that will also plays anything (and I mean ANYTHING) on your network or it's hardrive, gives you a cool photo-show viewer on the TV, great MP3/OGG/WMA/etc. player and all the other cool features (weather, streamed audio/video player, browser, etc). I love mine, cost the price of a cheap hack-chip to install (about $30).

Did you see the new Nokia 770 Internet Tablet? <http://www.nokia.com/770>   
It has a good size screen with huge resolution, RS-MMC card slot, USB, WiFi, Bluetooth and... Linux!! It's fully open sourced ([http://www.maemo.org](http://www.maemo.org/)) and very extensible.   
The best of all is that you can buy one at a price relatively cheap. Around $360 in USA. [](javascript:__doPostBack\('_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$_ctl0$Comments$_ctl0$Comments$_ctl1$EditLink',''\))
