I think it's time to start for me too :). I'm Daniel, a big fan of .NET, C#, XML and design patterns. I wrote 4 books for the extint Wrox Press (about ASP.NET and Server Controls), as well as some articles for C# Today and ASP Today. I was a speaker at the [.NET ONE 2002](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/dotnet_2002/program/sessions.htm) conference also ([slides](http://www.sigs.de/download/dotnet_02/)), where I presented the [NMatrix](http://sf.net/projects/dotnetopensrc) project, a personal endeavour I started back in May 2001, in a joined effort with my german friend Rainer and [Paul Speranza](http://weblogs.asp.net/Psperanza/) to contribute to the OpenSource community.

Almost a year ago, I joined [Lagash](http://www.lagash.com/) (spanish), the company started by four brilliant and excelent people [DiegoG](http://weblogs.asp.net/dgonzalez/posts/22746.aspx), DiegoB, Pablo and Julian. They really created a company that is the ideal of every entrepreneur: a frienly ambience, cool and smart people, a strong sense of teamwork and collaboration, and they are really superb in building a strong feeling of belonging and community among us. It's really great and I'm very lucky they found me. Thanks God for that one ;)

Before Lagash, I tried to start my own company, [DEVerest](http://deverest.com.ar/), but it got mixed with my efforts with NMatrix, and later Lagash turned out to be everything I ever wanted from my own company, so why start from scratch? I perceive myself an integral part of Lagash, share its goals and put all my energies in it. I only wish I was there when they founded it :(.

Recently, [VGA](http://weblogs.asp.net/vga) also joined us, another clever guy I met in the Wrox days.  
I will be posting some code, and thoughts about programming, movies and books I read. 

Let's start the real blogging now...
