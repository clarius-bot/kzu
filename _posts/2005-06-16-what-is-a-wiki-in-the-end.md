Is it the format? The idea of collaborative editing? Other features? [From the Wikipedia, the definition is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Overview_FAQ#What_is_Wiki.3F):  

> A _[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki")_ is a collaborative **collection** of interlinked web pages, all of which can be visited and edited by anyone at any time ([collaborative software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software "Collaborative software")). [Ward Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham "Ward Cunningham") invented the concept and software. You could even edit this page by clicking the "edit" link on the third tab above, or edit only a section by clicking on "[edit]" to its right! If you don't have anything to add or correct on this page and you just want to see how it works, try out the [Wikipedia:Sandbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox "Wikipedia:Sandbox"). See also [Wikipedia:Editing FAQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editing_FAQ "Wikipedia:Editing FAQ") and [WikiWiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWiki "WikiWiki").

So you can see that there's no reference whatesoever to the format.   
I know I hate the format (to make a nicely formatted table header with a bold title with a link, just type 
I know [we'll something about it](http://clariusconsulting.net/).
