I may be a little late, but I've just downloaded the latest version of [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) and it's * **amazing** *. I love the sidebar (although I don't like the all-COM-API for developers of panels :( ), but my favorite is being able to search using GDS from within Outlook :D (although the UI is very simple and there are a lot of features that I'd like to see in the future).  
  
Definitely, Google is getting closer and closer to killing the application I hate the most in my life with computers, that fat dog that eats 120+Mb RAM and freezes my computer every now and then, and sometimes eats 100% of my CPU....
