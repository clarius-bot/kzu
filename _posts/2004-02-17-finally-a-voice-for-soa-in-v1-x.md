Finally, [Hernan de Lahitte](http://weblogs.asp.net/hernandl) started blogging. He will touch architecture and in-depth details of Shadowfax, as he is one of the main architects and Senior Developer. For those that don't know what Shadowfax is, it's (IMO, exclusively) the Indigo for .NET v.1.x (v2 too?). He's a security paranaoid guy, I must say.... i.e. he has the firewall enabled inside the corp. LAN!! (no way to get any music shared from him :o))
