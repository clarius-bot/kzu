Seriously, WWWWW TTTTT FFFFFF ?!?!?!?!

From [http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01212412&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=3548164&lang=en](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01212412&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=3548164&lang=en "http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01212412&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=3548164&lang=en"):

And I already got mine, and now it's a piece of useless (though nice-looking) crap. Can't get the client connector to install.

DAMN IT!!!

**Update** : [there's a way to set it up](http://mswhs.com/2007/11/02/installing-the-connector-software-on-vista-x64/), and it's working fine so far. phiuuu!!!

#####  [How to get rid of the auto-generated #region for implemented interfaces](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2008/03/13/58374.aspx)

I HATE this default so much. Every stupid interface gets its own #region in my code file. I wonder who thought regions were so cool... 

Anyway, just go to Tools -> Options and please-please turn it off!!!
