IE is not my default browser. But still some links have to be sent to it in order for the right thing to happen (i.e. [Microsoft Lync](<www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=39d317af-3b6e-43cd-a53c-a0ef561e3355>) invitations, Live Meeting, InfoPath forms, etc.). So far I had the multi-click solution of opening IE, then clicking on a toolbar bookmark.

A coworker suggested to make the bookmarks shortcuts on the desktop for easier access. But as IE is not my default browser, that sends the link to Chrome in my case (Firefox or whatever in yours).

So, what I wanted was a Send To –> Internet Explorer:

Steps to set it up:

  * Open %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo 
  * Drop a shortcut to the application you want to enable “Send to” for 
  * In IE, with the page opened, do Alt + F (brings the File menu), Send –> Shortcut to Desktop 

That’s it. Now you can send the shortcuts directly to IE.
