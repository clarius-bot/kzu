## What's going on in PAG about smart clients? Composite UI Application Block (CAB) is coming! 

As [Eugenio](http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/archive/2005/06/16/430020.aspx) and [Edjez](http://blogs.msdn.com/edjez/archive/2005/06/09/CABPreview2.aspx) mentioned, the second [community drop of CAB](http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/cab) is around the corner. What you'll find in CAB is basically what's missing the raw widget framework of .NET (a.k.a. WinForms): support for reusability, life cycle management and shared state and events at the use case level, pluggable modules, injection of dependencies between components, and a very powerful loosely coupled event system/broker (among other things). Here's the team, in all its glory, after finally getting an official war room:

The war room has been substantially improved with a reorganization we did yesterday. I'll post more pictures later, but much more happy with the new layout :)  posted on Saturday, June 25, 2005 4:54 AM by [kzu](http://clariusconsulting.net/user/Profile.aspx?UserID=1004) ](src=)
