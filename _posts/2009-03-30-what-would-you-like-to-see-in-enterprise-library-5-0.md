There are few groups within Microsoft that are as open and so quick to deliver as [patterns & practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices). When you give them feedback or request features, chances are you'll see them implemented within months, rather than years (if they get enough support of the rest of the community!). 

It's now time to engage in shaping EntLib 5.0! From [Grigori's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/agile/archive/2009/03/27/enterprise-library-5-0-tentative-product-backlog-published-story-feature-prioritization-is-open-your-participation-is-invited.aspx):

> At this point, we would like to invite you to select and prioritize candidate features/stories you care about. Please review them carefully along with the associated effort estimates and cast your votes. Do remember to stay within the budget (100 points). Here's the link to the [online survey](http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB228YZEBVGGB).

I wish the format for the survey was more user friendly, but don't let that stop you from voting!
