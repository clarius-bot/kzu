For quite some time now, I've been lucky enough to be involved in various projects from Microsoft [patterns & practices](http://microsoft.com/practices). I've already posted about the [previous war room we had](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/06/25/CabDrop2.aspx) and also mentioned that we were improving it. Here's a picture of the setup process:

Finally, some pictures of the [CompositeUI application block](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/06/30/5301.aspx) team, and a couple [EntLib ](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/Workspace.aspx?id=295a464a-6072-4e25-94e2-91be63527327)guys too:

This time I didn't have time to add the bubbles showing the names of each, but I will, eventually :o)
