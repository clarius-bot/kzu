## Working for patterns &amp; practices rocks

I've already posted about the [previous war room we had](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/06/25/CabDrop2.aspx) and also mentioned that we were improving it. Here's a picture of the setup process:

This time I didn't have time to add the bubbles showing the names of each, but I will, eventually :o)
