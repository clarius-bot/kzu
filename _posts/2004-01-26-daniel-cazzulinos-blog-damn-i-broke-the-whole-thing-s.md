## Damn!!! I broke the whole thing!!! :S 

I'm the one to blame for breaking the site. Sorry guys! Inadvertently, I placed an XML element on the title, and it broke everything. What's more, I couldn't even delete the post afterwards because the Admin UI was broken too. I had to dump the Admin page to disk, fix the problem by hand, reload it and finally delete the post. Sorry!!!!
