## Teamwork and introspective analysis to make things better: a must in every project 

A couple weeks ago, as we approached an [important milestone for CAB](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/cabctp.asp), we had a session where we analyzed the job we did, not only technically but in every aspect. This introspection about how we work and interact as a team led to an interesting set of post-its on the wall:

After we grouped the notes according to the area (from technology/infrastructure to process/doc) and split the possitive and negative ones, we discussed them in turn. (tip: the picture is pretty high quality, so if you zoom enough, you may be able to read some ;)). It was very possitive to be able to express what we think about the project, the team and the environment. It made us think about it, reflect and find points for improvement. [Edjez](http://blogs.msdn.com/edjez) couldn't avoid going to the whiteboard, of course:

Process-wise, this is a very good practice that we'll surely be applying at [ClariuS](http://clariusconsulting.net/).
