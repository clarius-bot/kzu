## Don't miss the new cool addition from MS patterns &amp; practices: integration with VS was never so easy.... 

For the past 6 months I've been the dev lead on a new framework coming from PAG, called the Guidance Automation Toolkit (or GAT). With it you'll be able to package so-called recipes that can greatly enhance your developers experience and productivity, by providing guidance that comply with your own processes and rules. PAG will be using this same framework to deliver integrated assistance on using the different application blocks and frameworks it releases, so working with them will be much easier than in the past too.   
  
It has been an exciting project, and I'm very pleased with the result. It makes it so much easier to do stuff for VS. And there's XML backing it, of course ;). Don't miss its first public announcement and appearance in an upcoming [PAG webcast tomorrow](http://www.pnplive.com/). It's the one called "Packaging Design and Architecture Guidance for Visual Studio". Go for it!  
  
Of course, I'll be blogging a lot more about it now that it's public... now you know why I was so quiet lately... ;)  
  
I'll keep all GAT-related posts in a [separate category](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/category/9898.aspx) for easier subscription. There's also a [patterns & practices](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/category/6331.aspx) category if you're interested in everything we do for PAG.
