Query: "how to replace ipod touch boot screen"  
Cuil: 1 result, completely unrelated to what I'm looking for  
Google: 140k results, including the one I was looking for in the first 10  
MS Live: 423k results, the actual answer nowhere to be found in the first 40 results (so, for practical purposes I guess it's the same as Cuil useless result too :))

Query: "how to locate active item in solution explorer vs"  
Cuil: 0 results  
Google: 2M+ results, VERY relevant to the search  
MS Live: 177k results, first couple links VERY relevant, following ones somewhat related

Maybe it's because they are geeky questions, but for me, Google is still king, and all the fuss about the ["the world's biggest search engine"](http://www.cuil.com/) is totally bogus.
