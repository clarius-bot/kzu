## Being in Somasegar's top 3 customer issues list 

Yesterday I posted about [how Microsoft is listening to customers](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/06/01/Bugs100.aspx), and specially the excelent experience I had using [Product Feedback](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/ProductFeedback/). Now it turns out that [one of my favorite bugs](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/ProductFeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=e2996990-64a5-4308-921d-245071e6f174), one that I reported and [kept pushing](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/ComponentsNotBack.aspx) [for almost](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/ComponentsBadReason.aspx) [a year now](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/LosingComponents.aspx), is in [Somasegar](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/)'s [top 10 customer issues](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2005/05/31/423327.aspx), third in the list :). I'm specially flattered about the description: 

> **Description:** Twice we resolved this issue as "Won't Fix" but because "kzu" kept pushing, reopening the bug and insisting we reconsider, we did and fixed it for Beta 2. I want to thank kzu for driving this issue for the community.

Fortunately [I reopened the bug](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/ComponentsNotBack.aspx) after he ran the query :o).... I only wish I had more support from ASP.NET MVPs (specially [those with strong reputation among the product team](http://clariusconsulting.net/vga)...)
