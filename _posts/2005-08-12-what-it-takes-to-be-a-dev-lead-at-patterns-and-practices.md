One very important area where a dev lead must excel, specially at [patterns & practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices) where there's a lot of interaction with product groups across Microsoft, is to be able to handle situations smoothly, keep several mind-threads and tasks running at the same time, etc., in other words, you have to be kind of a [juggler](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=juggler) with regards to people, projects, and so on.  
  
Peter is very good at it, not only metaphorically, as you can see ;)
