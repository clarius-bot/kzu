## Important OASIS specs 

Yesterday I received the following [important notice](http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2004-02-26-a.html): 

> OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee have approved a Committee Draft specification for the "Common Alerting Protocol Version 1.0"

I guess sooner or later we'll have another long awaited spec: 

> OASIS Bathroom Contention Technical Committee have approved a Committee Draft specification for the "Common [Avid Bathreader](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/02/18/75583.aspx) Syncronization Protocol Version 1.0"
