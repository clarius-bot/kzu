## Incredibly real, exciting and possible story! 

I can't stress enough how great [Neuromancer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441569595/deverest-20/) is. I read it twice in a month... it is THAT good.  
The author, [William Gibson](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/1044186/ref=br_dp__4/102-2085274-9847359), wrote this book back in 1985, when there was no Internet, no virtual reality, no Matrix movie!! Yet, he is the father of the "cyberspace" word, you can recognize a yet-to-be-created virtual reality device that "transmits" not only images but the full 5 senses to the user (the simestim), and he even mentions (and gives birth to) the Matrix! Yes... exactly with that name...   
A must-read for Matrix lovers, technology fans and those who wonder what the near future may look like....
