## Silverlight + Seadragon = amazing Hard Rock memorabilia 

Just go and see it at the [Memorabilia Hard Rock](http://memorabilia.hardrock.com/) site.

I thought it would take years for [Seadragon](http://labs.live.com/Seadragon.aspx) to see the light in a product. How fast is Microsoft moving these days... (in some areas ;))
