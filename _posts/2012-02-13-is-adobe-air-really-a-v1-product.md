That’s a [TINY app](<http://snook.ca/snitter/>) built with [Adobe AIR](<http://www.adobe.com/products/air/>) taking roughly 112Mb of memory?!

If only MS made [Silverlight](<http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/>) available for standalone apps too… I’m willing to bet they’ll do much better than this even for their initial release with .NET built-in (Silverlight 2.0).
