## XInclude in .NET v2? 

Now that the [XInclude](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xinclude-20041220/) spec [is officially a Recomendation](http://www.w3.org/News/2004#item205), is it too late to include it in System.Xml v2? Unfortunately I think so :(  
Luckily, you can still use it in your apps by using the [Mvp.Xml](http://mvp-xml.sf.net/) project [XInclude.NET](http://mvp-xml.sourceforge.net/xinclude/index.html).
