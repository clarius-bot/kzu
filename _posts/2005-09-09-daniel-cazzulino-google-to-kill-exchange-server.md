## Google to kill Exchange Server? 

There are a lot of mail servers out there. Most web UIs for them suck really bad. The only one that is usable is OWA, bundled with Exchange.   
  
But [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/) is different. Even being a web app, it's way more responsive than Outlook itself, IMO. Everything works fast and as expected, and I can even add [cool extensions](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) [to it](http://userscripts.org/tag/gmail) like [search folders](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/801) and a [delete button](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1345) ;).  
  
Now, **when will they offer a mail server with their cool WebMail GUI** for sell?? I know for sure that I will certainly be interested in buying such a product for [my own company](http://clariusconsulting.net/)... (of course, it would be great if it's extensible so that even if they do not provide built-in support for things like Outlook appointments, tasks assignments and the like, some other company can develop it)
