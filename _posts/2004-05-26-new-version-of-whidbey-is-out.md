## New version of Whidbey is out! 

In case you haven't heard, the Visual Studio 2005 Community Technology Preview May 2004 is available to all MSDN subscribers! :D

It's funny how I found it, as it was released less than 2 days ago and not even the new [MSDN Subscriber Downloads](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/rss.xml) was updated, although I've just checked the [Visual Studio 2005 Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/) and it now contains the news. I was just about to report a bug through the new MSDN Feedback Center, when I had to choose the version, and guess what, a new one was there! :o)

I wish the feed was updated more often. In fact, that should be the first one, as it's probably the one requiring less work, IMO.
