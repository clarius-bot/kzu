Peter is much more elocuent than me, so [I'll let you read his post with the announcement](http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/06/30/5301.aspx). CAB is a very important step forward for developing rich client applications with good architectural design. Don't miss it if you're doing/planning to do any further WinForms development.
