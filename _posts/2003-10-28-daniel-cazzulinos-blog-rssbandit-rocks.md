## RssBandit Rocks! 

[Finally](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=59ba8459-820f-4b18-aa3d-71a7ff686d7c), RssBandit no longer freezes, it works flawlessly, is full featured and a real pleasure to use. It's my new default reader (goodbye SharpReader!!!) And Roy, I must say [you're wrong](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/posts/34050.aspx). You need to have a look at the latest version. Well done Dare!!
