I just found the following [excelent guidelines](http://www.paulstovell.net/blog/index.php/xaml-and-wpf-coding-guidelines) (especially the ones on resources organization) at [Paul Stovell's blog](http://www.paulstovell.net/blog).

I think it would be great to have community-developed guidelines on this topic. I've proposed to Paul to use [Jottit](http://jottit.com/), which is brain dead simple and uses the increasingly popular [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

Would be nice to point everyone to <http://wpf.jottit.com/> and <http://xaml.jottit.com/> for this kind of advice :)
