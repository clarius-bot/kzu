Is it just me or the X220 is just plain better in almost all relevant fronts?

Chipset/CPU Intel®  Display  Weight  | Up to 10 hours with slice battery  | Up to 23 hours with the 9 cell battery along with the ThinkPad external battery pack   
  
The only thing that looks (potentially) better on the X1 is the redesigned keyboard with backlighting… 

Sigh… still waiting for a real no-compromises 13’’ from Lenovo. But the X220 is very very close. I’m as happy as one can be with my X201, so I’ll probably just skip the X1…
