This is a very handy utility that I’ve used consistently for years now. I’ve been updating it since VS 2003 days. Originally from [Scott’s blog](<https://bit.ly/TjR5aK>), IIRC.

You can just download the [vs2012cmdhere.inf](<https://bit.ly/vs2012cmdhere>), righ-click the downloaded .inf and select Install. This will add the following context menu:

And the command can even be uninstalled from Add/Remove programs.

Enjoy!
