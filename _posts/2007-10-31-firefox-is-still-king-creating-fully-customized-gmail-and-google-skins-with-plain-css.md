Just get the [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/stylish/) add-on browse the huge library of community contributed styles to a myriad of sites. My customized Gmail hosted now looks much better (especially on my new small 12.1'' laptop :))

There's built-in support for browsing, searching and managing your styles, very much on the spirit of another great Firefox add-on, [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/):
