## IE-killer (and maybe aggregators too?) features in the best-browser ever 

In case you didn't noticed (I realized today :o)), [the best browser ever](http://getfirefox.com/) was released as v1.0. I thought it was going to be mainly bug fixing since the last version I installed (0.9.3), until I noticed a red icon at the bottom-right of the screen while I was reading a webblog post, with the following tooltip: "Add Live Bookmark for this page's feed".   
  
They add a bookmark that acts as a bookmark folder (with the title of the weblog by default), and update the entries in the folder directly from the RSS feed!!! Now THAT's what I call to evolve the browsers! Meantime, IE team is trying to come up with a release that tightens security... there's an abismal difference that would take much more investment from MS to catch-up again, although I doubt they want to... My guess is they'll bet everything to Avalon, and try to get rid of IE with it by offering richer user experience for sites Avalon-aware (not that I like the idea at all....)
