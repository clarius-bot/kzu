When you finish the setup, the configuration wizard may not start, and upon starting it manually, you might get:

> The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect.

The hack to make it run is not pretty, but it's straightforward. Just follow the steps in [MySQL Server 5.0.51a Installation guide for Windows Vista](http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?11,195569,195569#msg-195569) which also works with Win2008.
