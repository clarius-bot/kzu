## Presenting at TechEd 2005: ARC412 Packaging Design and Architecture Guidance for Visual Studio 

It's an honor to [be there](http://www.msteched.com/content/sessions.aspx) presenting a [new framework](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2005/04/20/GATAnnouncement.aspx) from [Microsoft patterns & practices](http://www.microsoft.com/practices) (developed jointly with [Clarius Consulting](http://clariusconsulting.net/)) that I believe is a significant step forward in terms of packaging guidance and productivity boosters for Visual Studio (formerly done almost exclusively as add-ins). The new programming model (relying on XML quite heavily but also on simple concepts that you just code in .NET) is much easier grasp and I'm pretty sure many will never write a VS add-ins again ;).   
  
Now I only have to find the time to start sharing how to use it....
