We've a [community site for GAT](http://guidanceautomation.net/), where you can [get the hands on lab that we did for TechEd 2005](http://guidanceautomation.net/library/View.aspx?Id=7). Go get it if you want to have a very comprehensive idea of what's possible with [GAT](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/teamsystem/workshop/gat/)....
