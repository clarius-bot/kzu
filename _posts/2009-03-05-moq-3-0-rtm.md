## Moq 3.0 RTM!!! 

I've just [released the latest version of Moq](http://moq.me/get) :))))

It's quite late on an intense week at Redmond, so I'm just going to paste the relevant portion of the [changelog](http://code.google.com/p/moq/source/browse/trunk/Changelog.txt):
    
    
      
    Version 3.0  
    
    
      
        * Silverlight support! Finally integrated Jason's Silverlight contribution! Issue #73  
    
    
      
        * Brand-new simplified event raising syntax (#130): mock.Raise(foo => foo.MyEvent += null, new MyArgs(...));  
    
    
      
        * Support for custom event signatures (not compatible with EventHandler): mock.Raise(foo => foo.MyEvent += null, arg1, arg2, arg3);  
    
    
      
        * Substantially improved property setter behavior: mock.VerifySet(foo => foo.Value = "foo");  //(also available for SetupSet  
    
    
      
        * Renamed Expect* with Setup*  
    
    
      
        * Vastly simplified custom argument matchers: public int IsOdd() { return Match<int>.Create(v => i % 2 == 0); }  
    
    
      
        * Added support for verifying how many times a member was invoked: mock.Verify(foo => foo.Do(), Times.Never());  
    
    
      
        * Added simple sample app named StoreSample  
    
    
      
        * Moved Stub functionality to the core API (SetupProperty and SetupAllProperties)  
    
    
      
        * Fixed sample ASP.NET MVC app to work with latest version  
    
    
      
        * Allow custom matchers to be created with a substantially simpler API  
    
    
      
        * Fixed issue #145 which prevented discrimination of setups by generic method argument types  
    
    
      
        * Fixed issue #141 which prevented ref arguments matching value types (i.e. a Guid)  
    
    
      
        * Implemented improvement #131: Add support for It.IsAny and custom argument matchers for SetupSet/VerifySet  
    
    
      
        * Implemented improvement #124 to render better error messages  
    
    
      
        * Applied patch from David Kirkland for improvement #125 to improve matching of enumerable parameters  
    
    
      
        * Implemented improvement #122 to provide custom errors for Verify  
    
    
      
        * Implemented improvement #121 to provide null as default value for Nullable<T>  
    
    
      
        * Fixed issue #112 which fixes passing a null argument to a mock constructor  
    
    
      
        * Implemented improvement #111 to better support params arguments  
    
    
      
        * Fixed bug #105 about improperly overwriting setups for property getter and setter  
    
    
      
        * Applied patch from Ihar.Bury for issue #99 related to protected expectations   
    
    
      
        * Fixed issue #97 on not being able to use SetupSet/VerifySet if property did not have a getter  
    
    
      
        * Better integration with Pex (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Pex/)  
    
    
      
        * Various other minor fixes (#134, #135, #137, #138, #140, etc.)
