For the past year I had the pleasure of working at Lagash Systems SA, a high-end consulting firm in Argentina, run buy really cool guys who created a company that is by far the best place you can work in Argentina right now. You won't find Morts there, only Einsteins. It was really an excelent experience, working with clever people, doing interesting and advanced stuff, and sharing knowledge as I had never seen in other companies. I can honestly say that my [ initial expectations](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2003/08/22/24957.aspx) were easily surpassed. The company afforded a diving course (including the initiating trip to a "lake"!) for all of us, where we spent a couple great days, and they even gave me as a gift a beatiful cradle when [ my little](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2003/12/11/42902.aspx) baby Agustina was born, which will always make me remember them. All I can say is a big "thank you", I've nothing but gratitude to them.

However, it's a fact of life that you always want more. And it was time for me to start my own company. I had been working on my own before (a whole year devoted to .NET research and writing for Wrox, which eventually led me to be a speaker in [.NET ONE 2002](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/sd/kongresse/dotnet_2002/program/sessions.htm) in Frankfurt), but couldn't find a partner so share the effort, and then Lagash came. This time, I found such a partner, the brilliant and excelent guy Victor (a.k.a. [ vga](http://weblogs.asp.net/vga)). We share a common view about technology, and the enthusiasm to continuously learn new advanced stuff and play with the latest .NET bits we can get.

So it's now time for **Clarius Consulting SA** (clariusconsulting.com and clariusconsulting.net in the registration process now), where we expect to develop further our public visibility and share with the comunity the stuff we learn (mainly with Whidbey now) through our new site [ aspnet2](http://aspnet2.com/) (under construction still) and our books ([two](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590593618) of [them](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590593596) comming out soon from Apress). We have officially started the company (that is, we signed the appropriate papers with our lawyer) on March 15, 2004. An important day in our lives, and the beginning of interesting times, I'm sure...
