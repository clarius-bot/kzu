After knowing that a [google search for 'miserable failure'](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22miserable+failure%22&btnG=Google+Search) returns [Bush bio](http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html) (this was even [an article in the BBC news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3298443.stm)) I tried my ([invented](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/01/08/48613.aspx)) term ['bathreader'](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=bathreader&btnG=Google+Search) (an activity I believe should be legalized), and guess what: I'm the the only one returned :D (together with [VGA](http://weblogs.asp.net/vga/) that commented on my new alias :|).   
So my new weblog subtitle is: [Daniel Cazzulino (a.k.a. "kzu" and "avid bathreader") 's .NET and XML digress](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu). Self google-bombed :o).
