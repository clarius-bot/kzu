## MSDN XML Dev Center 

Dare is [announcing ](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=35121198-5d20-4546-8f9b-0c3c1d55ab22) the upcoming MSDN XML Dev Center (~ two weeks from launch), and asking for a tagline suggestion. Mine is:

> The asphalt for the Information Highway.

About covering newer, work-in-progress and unreleased stuff, I definitely think it makes for more compelling and interesting reading, **if mixed with today's technologies articles**. Having the mix means I can read those for today during work, and enjoy the edge-stuff at night at home :). It's a must that the article BEGINS by saying which versions of which draft/beta/platform are used for the discussion, so that whenever those either are deprecated/disappear/mutate or go Recomendations/Standard/RTM the reader knows that right from the start.

I also agree with [Oleg](http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/archives/000187.html) that they should be more theory/exploratory than the regular material.
