I know I'm years behind this, but just solved some range problems I had at home by using my existing Airport Express as a range extender in addition to a remote speaker, as explained in an article about [Linksys WRT54G, Airport Express, and WDS](http://rgbdream.com/2005/09/06/linksys-wrt54g-airport-express-and-wds/).
