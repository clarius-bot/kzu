## A more sound licensing scheme for CustomControls 

[Some time ago](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/posts/25688.aspx) I complained about a naive approach to the subject suggested in an [MSDN article](http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnetcontrollicensing.asp?frame=true#aspnetcontrollicensing_topic8). It looks like I was [not the only one](http://www.sevenobjects.com/licensing.aspx) thinking along the lines of signed licencing files :o) 

**Update:** [another product](http://www.dotnetlicensing.com/) also exists, which is more powerful and mature, judging by its features description and blog comments...
