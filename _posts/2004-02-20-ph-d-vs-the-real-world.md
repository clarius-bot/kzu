In a [previous post](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/02/20/WxsTypeSystem.aspx) I showed and discussed the similarities between the W3C XML Schema type system and the CLR one. Dare [commented](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b2e5fe03-2205-402a-be18-7da10a9a66fe) on it by mentioning a number of already known (at least by me) issues with WXS->CLR mappings, specially the fact that the later supports only a subset of the former.   
Given the overwhelming response in favor of similarities against differences (~~10~~ 13 to 0 so far), I can only say that Dare is probably ignoring that most developers are **.NET DEVELOPERS** , NOT XML theorists and WXS fans. Therefore, most of them completely ignore or plainly don't care about the intricacies of WXS he's talking about. My question was about the features developers really use from WXS, and the answers I got speak for themselves.   

So, there's no tautological question as he argues. I can rephrase my question as follows: “If you ignore the parts that are irrelevant/impractical (such as no support from XmlSerializer)/overly-complex-to-be-of-any-use/only-for-WXS-fans/Ph.D-only-material, do the CLR and XSD type system fit well together?”. If I ask the people to vote again, I'm willing to bet whatever I have that I will get the same answer.

That's why [my weblog](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/) is titled "IXml* - **Welcome to the real world** ". Not only because I'm a big fan of [Matrix](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/) but because I care about what happens in the daily work with XML.
