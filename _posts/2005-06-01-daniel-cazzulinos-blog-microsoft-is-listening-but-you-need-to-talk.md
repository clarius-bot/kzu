## Microsoft is listening, but you need to talk 

I've broken the mark of 100 bugs entered thorugh [Product Feedback](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback)!!! I can only thank Microsoft for the diligence in reviewing, and even fixing most of them, even those that I qualified as less important. But when you report a bug, you have to be responsible for it, track it, provide more feedback when needed, regress them when they are fixed, etc. That's the only way you really contribute to the product. Most of my bugs were were acknowledged as such, and only a handful were either by design or not repro. I'm happy that most of them were resolved in one way or the other :).   
  
Contributing this way makes you definitely feel part of the process of helping the platform continue to rock!
