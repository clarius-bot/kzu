Is it just me or the X220 is just plain better in almost all relevant fronts?

The only thing that looks (potentially) better on the X1 is the redesigned keyboard with backlighting… 

Sigh… still waiting for a real no-compromises 13’’ from Lenovo. But the X220 is very very close. I’m as happy as one can be with my X201, so I’ll probably just skip the X1…
