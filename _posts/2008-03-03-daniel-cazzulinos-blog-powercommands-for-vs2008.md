## PowerCommands for VS2008 

From [Pablo's announcement](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/pga/archive/2008/03/02/57960.aspx):

> PowerCommands is a set of useful extensions for the Visual Studio 2008 adding additional functionality to various areas of the IDE.

I'm loving this add-on to VS. My favorites commands:

  * **Collapse Projects  
** This command collapses a hierarchy in the solution explorer starting from the root selected node. It can be executed from three different places: solution, solution folders and project nodes respectively. 
  * **Copy References  
** This command copies a reference or set of references to the clipboard. It can be executed from the references node, a single reference node or set of reference nodes. 
  * **Paste References**  
This command pastes a reference or set of references from the clipboard. It can be executed from different places depending on the type of project. For CSharp projects it can be executed from the references node. For Visual Basic and Website projects it can be executed from the project node. 
  * **Copy As Project Reference**  
This command copies a project as a project reference to the clipboard. It can be executed from a project node. 
  * **Edit Project File**  
This command opens the MSBuild project file for a selected project inside Visual Studio. It can be executed from a project node. 
  * **Open Containing Folder  
** This command opens a Windows Explorer window pointing to the physical path of a selected item. It can be executed from a project item node 
  * **Open Command Prompt**  
This command opens a Visual Studio command prompt pointing to the physical path of a selected item. It can be executed from four different places: solution, project, folder and project item nodes respectively. 
  * **Remove and Sort Usings**  
This command removes and sort using statements for all classes given a project. It can be executed from a solution node or a single project node. 

And there are many more. You can download it from [the new MSDN code gallery](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=559).
