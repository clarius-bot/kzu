## Team Foundation Power Toys, Vista compatible! 

If you're serious about working with TFS, and you fell the out-of-the-box experience (UI and command line) is lacking, you MUST go get these tools NOW.

In a nutshell:

> Team Foundation Server is happy to announce the release of version 1.2 of Team Foundation Power Tools (formerly known as Power Toys). In this release we’ve added 2 new command line tools for the developer and 3 non-command line tools. This version includes some bug fixes to previous Power Tools, support for Vista, and adds the following new functionality: 
> 
> · **Workspace Command (tfpt.exe) -** Use the workspace command for additional workspace operations not supported in the currently shipping Team Foundation Server command line (tf.exe). ****
> 
> ###  · Treeclean Command (tfpt.exe) - Use the treeclean command to see and optionally delete files in the current directory and all subdirectories that are not under version control.
> 
> ** **
> 
> · **Process Template Editor -** A tool to provide UI for authoring work item types and some of the associated Process Template components. 
> 
> ** **
> 
> · **Check-in Policy Pack -** A set of handy check-in policies to address needs customers have expressed.
> 
> ** **
> 
> · **Build Test Tools Task -** A tool that allows running unit tests by simply specifying the DLLs or even specifying a file name pattern in TfsBuild.proj, instead of using .vsmdi files to specify tests to run.
> 
> Please note that the Process Template Editor has some additional pre-requisites, they are identified on the download page.
