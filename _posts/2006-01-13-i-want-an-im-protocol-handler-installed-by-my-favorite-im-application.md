## I want an im:// protocol handler installed by [my favorite IM application]

## I want an im:// protocol handler installed by [my favorite IM application]

I'm SO used to typing WinKey + R,mailto://[address], that I seldom open Outlook's main window to send mails. Even more, Gmail (I don't remember if it was google desktop) can take control of the protocol and open up its compose webpage.

```
mailto://[address]
```

I started doing the same with Skype calls by using the same combination but withcallto://[user](if only my buddypartnerwould have a shorter alias instead ofcallto://victorgarciaaprea...).

```
callto://[user]
```

Now I only needim://[hopefully short buddy alias here](guess which is my partner's :S:S:S).....

```
im://[hopefully short buddy alias here]
```

And what aboutpost://[my new post title here]to fire-up the default weblog post authoring app? (even if it's openening your blog engine webpage...)

```
post://[my new post title here]
```
