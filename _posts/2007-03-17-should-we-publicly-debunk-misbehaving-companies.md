## Should we publicly debunk misbehaving companies?

I've been thinking lately about the influence we (especially bloggers) have in the world through the internet. I know many guys with much more power (as in google page rank ;)) than myself, but nevertheless, I realize I can also cause quite some damage.

In my last post I wrote about myawful experience with a little hotelcalledHotel Kappa. Just a day after I posted, google is showing my post right on thefirst search result page, right below the entry for the hotel main site. It's a powerful feeling, but do you think we should do this? I surely wanted to warn prospective customers, but would you be comfortable knowing that most probably a large percentage of them will not go there no matter if they fixed the issues I had? Or years from now?

I can almost hear "with great power comes great responsability"... ;). What do you think?
