## How to make Microsoft work for you 

[Microsoft Patterns & Practices](http://www.microsoft.com/practices) (a.k.a. PAG or Prescriptive Arquitecture Guidance) ships guides and application blocks based mostly on customer feedback. They are now working on the next generation of [Smart Client](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=60dd1bb9-0d1e-45e0-975a-a7f398697344) tools. If you develop rich client apps, you know it's not easy to be "smart" besides just being "rich". Now you have an opportunity to put MS to work on your problems by [filling the survey they prepared for that](http://www.zoomerang.com/survey.zgi?p=WEB2PTKA74NA).   
  
Believe me, they do extensive analysis on these surveys, and they definitely shape what's delivered.
