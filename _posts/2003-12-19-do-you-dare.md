Every now and then I smash against Dare's opinions such as ~~[this one](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=6523c363-1572-46bd-8ded-abf206c06569)~~ or [that one](http://weblogs.asp.net/tmarman/posts/43836.aspx#43839) _or[his final word on the matter](http://www.shahine.com/omar/CommentView.aspx?guid=4e17eb7d-7f04-4ab3-b5a8-9c8b4821545a)_ . And everytime I do, the more he becomes an important independent, objective and qualitative voice for me, and the less I think of him as a MSftie (although he joined pretty recently).   
I hope he has a long career inside MS. More minds like his inside there and the positive signs we see here and here may spread, and turn MS into a company we can love, instead of looking at it with distrust, with our back against a wall ;)
